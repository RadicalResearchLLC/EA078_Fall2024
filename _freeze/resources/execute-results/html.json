Functions that come in R are in-built functions. However, the real power of R (and programming languages more generally) are the large number of user-built functions that are built to perform tasks that can be loaded into base R.\n\nSets of functions that have a common purpose are bundled together in R in \"packages\". There are literally thousands of packages custom-built for R.\n\nDuring this course, I will ask you to use some important packages for data acquisition, tidying, and visualization. There are two steps to using a package in R.\n\nFirst, it needs to be installed. Here's a non-functional example.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('<PACKAGE.NAME>')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAnd this example will install an actual package called `janitor`. This package features a nice import function that fixes column names on import called clean_names().\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages('janitor')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn a meta way, you now have used a function to install a package. 'install.package()' is an example of an in-built R function.\n\nOnce a package is installed, it needs to be loaded. While the installation has put the package on your computer, you need to tell R that it should load these functions for use.\n\n::: {.callout-note appearance=\"simple\"}\nR and other programming languages only do EXACTLY what they are told to do.\n:::\n\nLoading a package is accomplished by calling base R `library` function. Success is indicated with a message like \"Attaching package: 'janitor'\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(janitor)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'janitor'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    chisq.test, fisher.test\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nLibraries have to be loaded each time you restart your R session. The current libraries loaded can be founded in the file manager panel under the `Packages` tab.\n\n### Color Resources\n\nCourtesy of Dalai Vo - Fall 2022 EA 078 student - a [color palette cheatsheet](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/colorPaletteCheatsheet.pdf)\n",
